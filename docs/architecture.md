# Introduction

The following document will provide a comprehensive overview of the PinguBot architecture, including a detailed breakdown of its components and how they are programmed and used. This architecture has been designed to streamline the development and testing process, making it easier for contributors to get up to speed and accelerate their contributions.

# Architecture

The bot architecture is designed to streamline the process of software testing, including fuzzing and crash analysis. The architecture consists of several components, each with its own purpose and function within the framework.

1. **Build management**: This component is responsible for building and managing the bots, including setting up a CI/CD pipeline to ensure seamless deployment.
2. **Config**: This component holds the Python classes that represent the `local_config` and `db_config` settings. These classes are responsible for managing the various configurations and settings required for the bot to function properly.
3. **Crash analysis**: This component performs automated analysis of crashes and bugs to identify root causes and generate detailed reports.
4. **Datastore**: This component stores the data generated by the bot, including crash reports, error logs, and other relevant information.
5. **Fuzzing**: This component is responsible for automated software testing using a process called fuzzing, which involves throwing random data at a program to create invalid inputs and expose bugs.
6. **Minimizer**: This component is designed to minimize the test coverage of the fuzz testing process, reducing the number of test cases without reducing the accuracy of the fuzz results.
7. **Platforms**: This component allows the bot to operate on multiple platforms, including Android, Linux, and Windows.
8. **Protos**: This component holds the bot's protocol definitions, including messages and formats used for communication with other components of the architecture.
9. **Scripts**: This component includes scripts that can be run by the bot to automate tasks or perform specific operations.
10. **Stack traces**: This component generates stack traces for crash reports, providing information on the steps that led to the crash.
11. **Startup**: This component manages the bot's startup and shutdown processes, including initializing the system and handling errors.
12. **System tasks**: This component performs various operations related to the functioning of the bot, including scheduling tasks and handling exceptions.
13. **Tokenizer**: This component performs tokenization, which is the process of breaking down a string of text into smaller units called tokens.
14. **Utils**: This component includes various utilities and helper functions that can be used to make the bot more efficient and flexible.
15. Web server: This component allows the bot to be accessed through a web-based interface, providing a user interface for interacting with the bot or accessing its functionality remotely.



# Bot working Directory

In additional to the bot architecture, the `bot_working_directory` contains the project's configuration data, including settings and parameters that are important for the bot to function properly. These settings and parameters are stored in the `env.yaml` file, which contains the specific instructions for running the bot. Additionally, the directory contains other necessary subdirectories that the bot will need to access during its execution, such as the `crash-stacks`, `data-bundles`, `fuzzers`, `image`, `mutator-plugins`, and more. These subdirectories contain the data and resources that the bot needs to perform specific tasks, such as testing and data analysis.

The `bot_working_directory` contains various subdirectories for different purposes related to the bot. The following is a brief description of each subdirectory:

1. `builds`: Stores the builds of the bot or its components that have been generated after successful compilation.
2. 'build-urls': Contains the URL's used for building or building-related resources.
3. `cache`: Stores the cached information, such as frequently accessed data or project-specific data that needs to be retrieved quickly.
4. `inputs`: Contains the input data or resources required in the testing process, such as fuzzers, test cases, images, symbols, and more.
    1. `crash-stacks`: a folder containing the stack traces of previously crashed programs.
    2. `data-bundles`: a folder containing data bundles that are used during the bot's operation.
    3. `fuzzer-common-data-bundles`: a folder containing common data bundles used during the fuzzer operation.
    4. `fuzzers`: a folder containing the fuzzers used during the testing process.
    5. `fuzzer-testcases`: a folder containing the test cases used during the fuzz test.
    6. `fuzzer-testcases-disk`: a folder containing the test cases used during the fuzz test that are stored on disk.
    7. `images`: a folder containing the images used during the testing process.
    8. `mutator-plugins`: a folder containing the mutator plugins used during the testing process.
    9. `symbols`: a folder containing the symbols used during the testing process.
    10. `user-profile-dirs`: a folder containing the user profile directories used during the testing process.
6. 'logs': Stores the logs and other related information related to the bot's execution.
